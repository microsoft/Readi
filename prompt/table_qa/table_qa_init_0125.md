You should predict the reasoning path in a table for the question.
Note: you can only choose header from given Headers. Example rows in table are given to show meaning of each header.
Think step by step.
Give the logical form of your reasoning path, [ENTITY] represents starting entity. If no entity is specified for an aggregation question, use [] to start a path.
Finally, present your Chosen Headers in python list format.

Question: what was the last year where this team was a part of the usl a-league?
| Year | Division | League | Regular Season | Playoffs | Open Cup | Avg. Attendance |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 2001 | 2 | USL A-League | 4th, Western | Quarterfinals | Did not qualify | 7,169 |

Example Row: "2001", "2", "USL A-League", "4th, Western", "Quarterfinals", "Did not qualify", "7,169"
<Thought>
According to headers and example rows, the question requires the year and the league each row of the team.
First, I need to constrain League = "usl a-league", so the topic entity is [usl a-league].
Second, I need to know the team where "League" = "usl a-league", so I need the header "League".
Third, I need to know the year of the team in "League" = "usl a-league", so I need the header "Year".
</Thought>
Logical Form: [usl a-league] -> "League" -> "Year"
Chosen Headers: ["League", "Year"]

Question: how many people stayed at least 3 years in office?
| | Name | Took Office | Left Office | Party |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 11 | William McCreery | March 4, 1803 | March 3, 1809 | Democratic Republican |
<Thought>: 
According to headers and example rows, the question requires the Took office and Left office of each row to calculate the staying time for each person.
First, I recognize this is an aggregation question counting the number of people, and no specified topic entity is given, so the topic entity is [].
First, I need to know the "Took office" time of people, so I need the header "Took office".
Second, I need to know the "Left office" time of people, so I need the header "Left office".
</Thought>
Logical Form: [] -> Took office  -> Left office
Chosen Headers: ["Took officer", "Left office"]

Question: who was the opponent in the first game of the season?
| Date | Opponent | Venue | Result | Attendance | Scorers |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 15 August 1987 | Derby County | Away | 0–1| 17,204 | — |
<Thought>
According to headers and example rows, the question requires the Date and opponent of each row.
First, I recognize this is an aggregation question about the first game of a season of a team, and no specified topic entity is given, so the topic entity is [].
Second, I need to know the "Date" of game to know the first one, so I need the header "Date".
Third, I need to know the "Opponent" of that game, so I need the header "Opponent".
</Thought>
Logical Form: [] -> Date -> Opponent
Chosen Headers: ["Date", "Opponent"]

Question: which is deeper, lake tuz or lake palas tuzla?
| Name in English | Name in Turkish | Area (km2) | Depth | Location (districts and/or provinces) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Lake Van | Van Gölü | 3755 km2 | 451 m | Van, Bitlis |
<Thought>
According to headers and example rows, the question requires the "Name in English" and "Depth" of each row.
First, I need to know the depth of "lake tuz" and "lake palas tuzla", so the topic entity is [lake tuz, lake palas tuzla].
Second, I need to know the lake "Name in English" = "lake tuz" and "lake palas tuzla", so I need the header "Name in English".
Third, I need to know the "Depth" of these two lakes, so I need the header "Depth".
</Thought>
Logical Form: [lake tuz, lake palas tuzla] -> Name in English -> Depth
Chosen Headers: ["Name in English", "Depth"]

Question: which ship in auckland had the fastest speed in knots?
| Name | Dates | Grt | Propulsion | Port | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Arataki  i | 1948-84 | 74 | 320 bhp diesel, 10 knots (19 km/h) |  | US Navy harbour tug |
<Thought>
According to headers and example rows, the question requires the "Name", the "Propulsion" and "Port" of each row.
First, I need to know the ship in Port "auckland", so the topic entity is [auckland].
Second, I need to know the ship in "Port" = "auckland", so I need the header "Port".
Third, I need to know the speed of the ship, so I need the header "Propulsion".
Fourth, I need to know the "Name" of the ship, so I need the header "Name".
</Thought>
Logical Form: [auckland] -> Port -> Propulsion
Chosen Headers: ["Port", "Propulsion", "Name"]
