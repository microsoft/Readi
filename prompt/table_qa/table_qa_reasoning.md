Question: how many people stayed at least 3 years in office?
<Thought>
Headers: took office, left office

First, I know some took office time and left office time of people from items in Table.
Second, I calculate that the first person stayed 1809-1803=6 years, the second stayed 1815-1809=6 years, the third stayed 1816-1815=1 year, the fourth stayed 1823-1816=7 years, the fifth stayed 1825-1823=2 years, the sixed stayed 1829-1825=4 years, the seventh stayed 1833-1829=4 years.
So we have 4 people (the first, second, fourth and seventh) stayed at least 3 years in total.
