Question: what was the first venue for the asian games??
| year | competition | venue | position | notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 2000 | Olympic Games | Sydney, Australia | 14th (q) | Democratic Republican |

Chosen Headers: ["venue"]
Constrains: {}

1. You must choose at least 2 headers from ['year', 'competition',  'venue',  'position', 'notes']. The ['venue'] is not enough to answer the question.

<Thought>:
First, previously I only chose header "venue" which is not enought to answer the question. I need to know the time of competition, and the "competition"="asian games" and I should return the "venue", so I need header "year", "venue" and "competition" from ['year', 'competition',  'venue',  'position', 'notes']. 
Second, I constrain the "competition" = "asian games" and calculate the first "year" and return the "venue", so I need {"competition":["asian games"]}.
</Thought>
Chosen Headers: ["year", "venue", "competition"]
Constrains: {"competition":["asian games"]}

| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 2001 | 2 | USL A-League | 4th, Western | Quarterfinals | Did not qualify | 7,169 |169"

Chosen Headers: ["year", "team"]

1. Header ['team'] not in candidate Headers. You can only choose headers from ["year", "division", "league", "regular season", "playoffs", "open cup", "avg. attendance"].
</Feedback>
<Thought>
First, previously I chose headers "Year" and "Team", but "team" is not in Header list. Following the feedback, I need the team in "league"="usl a-league" and return the latest year, so I need headers "year" and "league" from ["year", "division", "league", "regular season", "playoffs", "open cup", "avg. attendance"].
Second, I need to constrain "league" = "usl a-league", so I need {"league": ["usl a-league"]}.
Third, I need to know the latest "year".
</Thought>
Chosen Headers: ["year", "league"]
Constrains: {"league": ["usl a-league"]}
