>>>> Corrected Path
Goal: The Initial Path starts from Miley Cyrus, which should cover the movies featured by Miley Cyrus.
Thought: In Instantiate Paths I know that Miley Cyrus acts some films, described by a cvt node.
In candidates, I find "film.performance.film" most relevant to get the films.
Meanwhile, "film.film.producer" is not relevant to my Goal.
Final Path: Miley Cyrus -> film.actor.film -> film.performance.film

>>>> Corrected Path
Goal: The Initial Path starts from National Anthem of Bolivia, which should cover the country whose national anthem is National Anthem of Bolivia, and then the countries bordering this country.
Thought: In candidates, I find "government.national_anthem.national_anthem_of" most relevant to get the country with that national anthem.
Meanwhile, I find the relation "country.country.composer" and "person.person.nationality" in Initial Path irrelevant to get the country and the bordering country.
Final Path:  National Anthem of Bolivia -> government.national_anthem.national_anthem_of -> location.location.adjoins -> location.location.country

Question: What bordering countries are to the country that uses Bolivian Boliviano as its currency?
Initial Path: Bolivian boliviano -> country.country.currency -> country.country.bordering
>>>> Error Message
1. relation "country.country.bordering" not instantiated.
>>>> Instantiation Context
Instantiate Paths: Bolivian boliviano -> finance.currency.countries_used -> Bolivia
Candidate Relations: []
>>>> Corrected Path
Goal: The Initial Path starts from Bolivian boliviano, which should cover the country whose currency is Bolivian boliviano, and then the countries bordering this country.
Thought: In Instantiate Paths, I find that Bolivian boliviano is the currency used in Bolivia. No candidates are given, so I should pick some relations on my own.
Final Path: Bolivian boliviano -> country.country.currency -> location.location.adjoin_s

Question: Rift Valley Province is located in a nation that uses which form of currency?
Initial Path: Rift Valley Province -> place.administrative_division.country -> place.location.geolocation -> location.mailing_address.state_province_region -> finance.currency.countries_used
>>>> Error Message
1. <cvt></cvt> in the end. 
2. relation "location.mailing_address.state_province_region" not instantiated.
>>>> Instantiation Message
Instantiate Paths: Rift Valley Province -> location.administrative_division.country -> Kenya -> location.location.geolocation -> <cvt></cvt>
Candidate Relations: ['location.geocode.latitude', 'location.geocode.longitude']
>>>> Corrected Path
Goal: Information needed in this path is from Rift Valley Province to the nation it is located in and then the form of currency used in this nation.
Thought: In Instantiate Paths, I find that Rift Valley Province is located in Kenya. And Kenya has some geolocations.
But "place.location.geolocation" and "location.mailing_address.state_province_region" seem irrelevant to the currency of Kenya.
And I should know the currency used in Kenya.
Final Path: Rift Valley Province -> location.administrative_division.country -> finance.currency.countries_used

>>>> Corrected Path
Goal: The Initial Path starts from United Kingdom, which should cover the major religion in United Kingdom.
Thought: In Instantiate Paths, I find that United Kingdom has some religions, described by a cvt node.
In candidates, I find "location.religion_percentage.religion" most relevant to major religions.
Final Path: United Kingdom -> location.statistical_region.religions -> location.religion_percentage.religion
