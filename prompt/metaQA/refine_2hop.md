Question: what types are the movies directed by [Tiffanie Debartolo]
Wrong Answer: ['director_to_movie']
<Feedback>
There should be 2 relations, but got 1.
</Feedback>
<Thought>
I should predict 2 reasoning relations. My previous answer director_to_movie can get movies directed by [Tiffanie Debartolo], but I need to know the types of the movies.
So I should add a relation from movie to type, that is movie_to_tags.
</Thought>
Logical Form: [Tiffanie Debartolo] -> director_to_movie -> movie_to_tags
Relations: ['director_to_movie', 'movie_to_tags']

Question: what types are the movies written by [Dana Delany]
Wrong Answer: ['writer_to_movie', 'movie_to_type']
<Feedback>
Relation movie_to_type not in candidate relations. You can only choose from actor_to_movie, movie_to_writer, tag_to_movie, writer_to_movie, movie_to_year, director_to_movie, movie_to_language, movie_to_genre, movie_to_director, movie_to_actor, movie_to_tags.
</Feedback>
<Thought>
I should predict relations from candidate relations. I predict the wrong relation movie_to_type, the correct relation should be movie_to_tags.
</Thought>
Logical Form: [Dana Delany] -> writer_to_movie -> movie_to_tags
Relations: ['writer_to_movie', 'movie_to_tags']

Question: who is listed as director of [Oliver Cooper] acted films
Wrong Answer: ['actor_to_movie', 'writer_to_movie']
<Feedback>
Previous reasoning path: [Oliver Cooper] -> actor_to_movie -> [Project X] -> writer_to_movie
Relation writer_to_movie not in candidate relations of entity [Project X].
You can only choose from ["movie_to_writer", "movie_to_director", "movie_to_actor", "movie_to_genre", "movie_to_year", "movie_to_tags"].
</Feedback>
<Thought>
First, I should predict the films starred by [Oliver Cooper].
Second, I should get the director of the movies.
My first relation actor_to_movie matches the first step, but my second relation is wrong. I should choose from the candidate relations of the entity [Project X], and get its director. So the relation should be movie_to_director.
</Thought>
Logical Form: [Oliver Cooper] -> actor_to_movie -> movie_to_director
Relations: ['actor_to_movie', 'movie_to_director']
