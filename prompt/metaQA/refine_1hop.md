Relation movie_to_type not in candidate relations. You can only choose from actor_to_movie, movie_to_writer, tag_to_movie, writer_to_movie, movie_to_year, director_to_movie, movie_to_language, movie_to_genre, movie_to_director, movie_to_actor, movie_to_tags.

I should predict relations from the candidate relations. I predict the wrong relation movie_to_type, the relation movie_to_tags correctly matches the meaning. So the real answer shall be movie_to_tags.
</Thought>
Relations: ["movie_to_tags"]
