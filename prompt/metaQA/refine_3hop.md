Question: who acted in the films directed by the director of [Terms of Endearment]
Wrong Answer: ['movie_to_director', 'director_to_movie']
<Feedback>
There should be 3 relations, but got 2
</Feedback>
<Thought>
I should predict 3 reasoning relations.
The first relation movie_to_director can get the director of [Terms of Endearment].
The second relation director_to_movie can get the films directed by the previous director.
Third, I need the actor of the films, that is movie_to_actor relation.
</Thought>
Logical Form: [Terms of Endearment] -> movie_to_director -> director_to_movie -> movie_to_actor
Relations: ['movie_to_director', 'director_to_movie', 'movie_to_actor']

Question: what types are the films directed by the director of [For Love or Money]
Wrong Answer: ['movie_to_director', 'director_to_movie', 'tag_to_movie']
<Feedback>
Previous reasoning path: [For Love or Money] -> movie_to_director -> [Barry Sonnenfeld] -> director_to_movie -> [Big Trouble] -> tag_to_movie
Relation tag_to_movie not in candidate relations of entity [Big Trouble].
You can only choose from movie_to_director, movie_to_writer, movie_to_year, movie_to_actor, movie_to_genre, movie_to_tags
Previous reasoning path: [For Love or Money] -> movie_to_director -> [Barry Sonnenfeld] -> director_to_movie -> [Men in Black 3] -> tag_to_movie
Relation tag_to_movie not in candidate relations of entity [Men in Black 3].
You can only choose from movie_to_director, movie_to_writer, movie_to_year, movie_to_actor, movie_to_genre, movie_to_tags
</Feedback>
<Thought>
My third predicted relation tag_to_movie dismatches the entity in the reasoning path. [Barry Sonnenfeld] and [Men in Black] are movies, I shall get the types of the films. So the real relation shall be movie_to_genre.

Logical Form: [For Love or Money] -> movie_to_director -> director_to_movie -> movie_to_genre
Relations: ['movie_to_director', 'director_to_movie', 'movie_to_genre']
