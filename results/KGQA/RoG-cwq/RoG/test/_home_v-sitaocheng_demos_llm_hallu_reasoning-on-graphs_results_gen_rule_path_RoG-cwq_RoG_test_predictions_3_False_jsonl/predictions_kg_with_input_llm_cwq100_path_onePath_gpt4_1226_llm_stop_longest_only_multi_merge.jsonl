Based on the Question, this path should cover the team Lou Seal is the mascot for, the championships won by the team, and the season of the last championship, to reach the answer (expectation).\nIn Grounded Knowledge, the relation \"sports.mascot.team\" seems relevant to get the team, the relation \"sports.sports_team.championships\" seems relevant to get the championships, and the relation \"sports.sports_championship_event.season\" seems relevant to get the season of the championship.\nFirstly, Lou Seal is connected to San Francisco Giants, through \"sports.mascot.team\", which means Lou Seal is the mascot for San Francisco Giants, this is relevant to the team of \"Lou Seal\". So I can refine the \"sports.mascot.team\" to \"sports.mascot.team\".\nSecondly, San Francisco Giants is connected to some championships, through \"sports.sports_team.championships\", which means San Francisco Giants won these championships, this is relevant to the championships of the team. So I can refine the \"sports.sports_team.championships\" to \"sports.sports_team.championships\".\nLastly, the championships are connected to some seasons, through \"sports.sports_championship_event.season\", which means these championships happened in these seasons, this is relevant to the season of the championships. So I can refine the \"sports.sports_championship_event.season\" to \"sports.sports_championship_event.season\".\nSo this whole path is grounded and Grounded Knowledge meets my expectation. \nSo I think we don't need to further refine the path to get more information.\n\n***STOP REFINE***", "input": "Lou Seal is the mascot for the team that last won the World Series when?"}
