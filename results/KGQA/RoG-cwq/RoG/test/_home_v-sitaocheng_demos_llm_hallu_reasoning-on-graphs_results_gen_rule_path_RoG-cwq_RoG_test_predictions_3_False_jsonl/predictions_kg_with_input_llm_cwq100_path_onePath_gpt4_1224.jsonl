Based on the Question, the path should cover the team that Lou Seal is the mascot for, and then the most recent championship won by that team, to reach the answer (expectation).\nIn the Grounded Knowledge, the relation \"sports.sports_team_mascot.team\" is grounded to \"sports.mascot.team\", and Lou Seal is connected to San Francisco Giants through this relation, which is faithful and meets part of my expectation. So I can refine the \"sports.sports_team_mascot.team\" to \"sports.mascot.team\".\nNext, I find that San Francisco Giants have won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014. However, the initial path has the relation \"sports.sports_championship.most_recent_winner\", which is not grounded in the Grounded Knowledge. I need to find the most recent championship among the grounded ones. Since 2014 is the most recent year among the grounded championships, I can refine the path to include the year of the championship.\nThe Refined Path is as follows.\n\nRefined Path: Lou Seal -> sports.mascot.team -> sports.sports_team.championships -> sports.sports_championship_event.year", "input": "Lou Seal is the mascot for the team that last won the World Series when?"}
